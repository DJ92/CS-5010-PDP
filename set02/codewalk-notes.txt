Notes:

Code must have 100% test coverage. You are expected to have minimum 100% test coverage of your code except of the big-bang.
Direction must be have a separate data definition. It cannot be any string.
xpos is the x-coordinate for the centre of the probe (minor)

probe-forward method is a big mess of code. Make use of helper functions to break down complex tasks. It simplifies the design and improves readability. (major)

probe-north? and other predicates has a condition which evaluates to a boolean. No need to make use of if statements. (minor)
Avoid using magic constants in your code (minor)

Code must have proper indentation
